The first part provides an overview of the opportunities for climate change mitigation from agricultural soil carbon sequestration, the emerging policy options and consequent institutional mechanisms for financing such mitigation, and the opportunities for smallholders to participate in them. The second part is aimed primarily at carbon project developers and decision makers at national level concerned with environmental and agriculture policies and incentives, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and farmersâ€™ associations working towards rural development and poverty alleviation. It provides step-by-step practical support to project development.",

It aims to enhance knowledge on carbon finance and facilitate\r\nthe integration of small-scale farmers into AFOLU mitigation activities. The participation of these farmers allows them to be involved in the development and implementation of the project, influence its design to generate positive impacts for the farmers and increase their knowledge about climate change mitigation and carbon finance."
