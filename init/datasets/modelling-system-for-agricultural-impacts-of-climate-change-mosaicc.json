   "notes" : "The aim of MOSAICC is to build capacities of experts in countries to understand potential climate change impacts better, and to help policymakers with climate change adaptation strategies, programmes, projects and investments.  \r\n\r\nInformation on the impacts of climate change is a primary resource for policy makers trying to cope with climate change. In recent years, scientists have developed a range of different models to monitor, evaluate and predict the effects of climate change; however, this information is often incomplete or focused exclusively on one scientific domain. \r\nFor that reason, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in partnership with European research institutes, developed MOSAICC - an innovative, interdisciplinary approach as an ideal tool to carry out climate change impact assessment studies at the national level.
