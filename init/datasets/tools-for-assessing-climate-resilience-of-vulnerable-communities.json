The survey is both paper and tablet based and assesses the resilience of farmers and pastoralists to climate change organized into governance, environmental, social, economic and agricultural practices using a combination of self-assessment and academic review of livelihood components. There are 54 questions in total of which 26 are mandatory to fully assess resilience. SHARP can be used both as a monitoring and evaluation tool, as well as a learning method integrated into agropastoral/ farmer field schools training curricula.",
