                <h2>Climate and Land Hub</h2>
                <p>The aim of this hub is to provide comprehensive resources to mobilize ambition and actions in the
                    agriculture and land sectors in relation to climate change. This hub intends to respond to countries
                    needs of stakeholder engagement and capacity development, facilitating access to effective tools,
                    guidance, policy advice and learning material in order to support decision makers and practitioners
                    to deliver on their climate and sustainable development goals. <br><br>
                    You can navigate through our resources by looking at climate change topics or at your specific
                    activity needs, as well as at a particular type of resources. You can then narrow down the results
                    using faceted search that allows you to choose one or more filters to progressively reduce the
                    resources, ensuring that the result is what youâ€™re looking for.
