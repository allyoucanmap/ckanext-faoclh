                The aim of this hub is to provide comprehensive resources to mobilize ambition and actions in the
                agriculture and land sectors in relation to climate change. This hub intends to respond to countries
                needs of stakeholder engagement and capacity development, facilitating access to effective tools,
                guidance, policy advice and learning material in order to support decision makers and practitioners
                to deliver on their climate and sustainable development goals.

                You can navigate through our resources by looking at climate change topics or at your specific
                activity needs, as well as at a particular type of resources. You can then narrow down the results
                using faceted search that allows you to choose one or more filters to progressively reduce the
                resources, ensuring that the result is what youâ€™re looking for.
